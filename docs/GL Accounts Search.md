The GL Accounts Search List Window gives you the ability to locate and access records created with the GL ACCOUNT MAINTENANCE APPLICATION as well as create new records.

For information about using this and all other search list windows, refer to the SEARCH LIST WINDOW topics.

##   
BASIC SEARCH for Records

Enter criteria in one or more of the fields above the columns at the top of the window if you're looking for a specific record or group of records and then hit the Enter key or click the Search button. The system will limit the results of the search to the records that match the values entered in the fields above each column (if you’ve entered anything at all).

If you want to locate all existing records, press the Enter key or click the Search Button without entering any criteria. You can clear previously-entered criteria by clicking the Clear button at the top right—hand corner of the window.

**NOTE**

Search criteria has been added to all search lists linked to maintenance records that have the ability to add Additional Contacts lists. These additions make it possible to search for records based on the people in a record’s Additional Contact list.

This specification has only added the ability to search by Additional Contact Lists. It does not include adding the data to the results to search lists.

## ADVANCED SEARCH for Records

For additional search criteria and to search by record creation dates, click the Filter button found at the top left of this window. A new Criteria window will open in which you can define your search criteria. Click the Search button in this window when ready to perform your search.

## OPEN/EDIT Existing Records

## CREATE New Records

You can click the View Saved Searches button to manage other saved searches. The Cancel button cancels the process and the Help button accesses this Help file.
